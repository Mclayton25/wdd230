                    Visual Hierarchy is a principle that artists and designers use to know how to 
                    structure visual characteristics. This principle helps the user easily 
                    interprit the inormation that is being portrayed. Visual Hierarchy items: Size, Color, Contrast, Alignment, Repetition, Proximity, 
                    Whitespace, Texture and Color

                   Samsung takes their front page and takes the users eyes so they focus on their most popular
                   items. They show phones, tvs, and other tech and then make it easy for the user to go to the
                   shop and buy what they would like.

                    This page follows great White Space rules and clean design. The phone is the 
                    prominent item being shown, but the space in the backround that matches the phone
                    color is well pronounced but not overpowering. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each attribute in this page is important and pronounced but not one of them overtakes the main
                    subject. The way the page keeps the users eyes focused on the phone but keeps everything easy to 
                    understand and find is clean and sharp.

                    The items are shown in an orderly manor, it is easy to navigate. The home and next buttons are 
                    easy to follow. The information provided in the bottom with the HTML tags is well defined
